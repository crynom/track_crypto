# Track Your Crypto Portfolio

I find most centralized exchage apps to have very poor portfolio tracking capailities, so I'm gonna make it worse.
The only way this could be better than using an app like Coinbase is if you don't have all of your stuff in a custodial wallet.

## To-do list

* Add covariance matrix for assets
* Add diffing between save/load
* I'll think of more as I go
* Make a run script
